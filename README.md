# Tetris

This project was the last project we have done this year at EPITA.

We had to put as much tetris pieces in a board as possible. We had one week to develop this solution.

For more information about the project, you can read tpcs14_fr_1.2.pdf
which explain (in french) what this project consist in.

We were free to do implement any solution we want to solve it. It was one of the funniest project we have done this year.

Once you have understand the file format as explain in the pdf, you can look at bin/Debug/output.out to see the optimal solution of the bin/Debug/input.in

You can also download it and test it yourself :D
